Your task is to help me grade code test output.

Here is the test output:

```
<actual>
```

Now, help me score the test output using the following criteria:

<assertions>

Based on these criteria, give the test output a score between 0.0 and 1.0.

- 0.0 means it doesn't meet any of the criteria.
- 1.0 means it meets all criteria.
- If the test output does not contain any of the text I said it "must" include, grade it 0.0.
- First, perform a short, succinct analysis of how the test output meets the criteria.
- On the last line of your response, write the grade as a single, floating-point number. Nothing else.
- **Always** end with a grade. The last line **must** be a floating-point number.

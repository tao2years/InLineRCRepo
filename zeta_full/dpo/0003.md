    // In a real application, you'd set up a render loop.
    state.render().unwrap();
}
```

2. Update your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package]
name = "wgpu-previewer"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
wasm-bindgen = "0.2"
wasm-bindgen-futures = "0.4"
web-sys = { version = "0.3", features = [
    "Document",
    "Window",
    "HtmlCanvasElement",
    "DomRect",
]}
wgpu = { version = "0.19", features = ["webgl"] }
console_error_panic_hook = "0.1"
console_log = "1.0"
log = "0.4"
```

3. In your `State::new` function, you can now use `create_surface_from_canvas` directly without conditional compilation:

```rust
impl State {
    async fn new(
        canvas: HtmlCanvasElement,
        shader_source: &str,
    ) -> Result<Self, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
        let instance = Instance::new(wgpu::InstanceDescriptor {
            backends: wgpu::Backends::all(),
<|editable_region_start|>
            ..Default::default()
        });

        let surface = instance.create_surface_from_canvas(&canvas)
            .map_err(|e| format!("Failed to create surface: {:?}", e))?;

        // ... rest of the function
    }
}
```

These changes will:
1. Ensure the code only compiles for the wasm32 target.
2. Remove the need for a separate `main` function.
3. Simplify the `Cargo.toml` by setting `crate-type = ["cdylib"]`.
4. Allow direct use of WebAssembly-specific functions without conditional compilation.

This approach is cleaner and more straightforward for a WebAssembly-only project. It removes any ambiguity about the target platform and simplifies the codebase.

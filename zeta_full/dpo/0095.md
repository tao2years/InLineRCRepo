We have a new Zed AI feature we've been working on for a few months: Edit Prediction.
Edit Prediction is an inline completion mechanism, similar to Copilot or Supermaven, that uses our new custom Zed model ("Zeta") to suggest edits you are likely performing next.

## Activating Edit Prediction

If you're within the beta group, you should see a little banner on the title bar, located at the upper right-hand corner of the app.

![Introduction banner in the title bar.](/img/post/edit-prediction-guide/banner.png)

When you click on it, you'll be presented with a modal.
The only requirement to turn Edit Predictions on is reading and accepting the Terms of Service.

![Edit Prediction Announcement Modal.](/img/post/edit-prediction-guide/onboarding-modal.png)

After you check that box off, `zed` will be automatically added as your `inline_completion_provider`, visible through the settings:

```json
<|editable_region_end|>
"features": {
  "inline_completion_provider": "zed"
}
```

## Optionally Sharing Training Data

If you work on open-source projects, you can also _optionally_ choose to share your code with us to train the model, which will help immensely to improve Zeta completions for you and for more languages.

You can only turn this setting on if Zed identifies that the project you're working on is open-source, which is done via looking for a `LICENSE` file in your worktree.
It is possible for us to not correctly detect that, though. Please let us know if that's the case!

If you turn this setting on, it will be valid for all open-source projects you come to work on.
Of course, you can turn this off at any time via the status bar menu.

![This information is also visible by clicking on the "Learn More" button in the announcement modal.](/img/post/edit-prediction-guide/onboarding-modal-details.png)

## Configuration Options

Also via the status bar menu, you can choose more granularly where Edit Predictions will work.
You can toggle it on for a certain file, language, or all files.
These settings are also available through the Command Palette.

## Give Us Feedback

We'd love any feedback you can throw our way about this new Zed AI feature!
We put a lot of work into making sure this integrates nicely into your workflow and within the existing editor features you're accustomed to.

Your feedback will be crucial in helping us refine and improve this feature before its general release.
Please send anything you'd like to share to `hi@zed.dev`.

Thanks!
Zed Team
